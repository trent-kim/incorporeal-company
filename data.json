I forgot how hilly my area was and my calf was really tight so I was focusing on that for a while. I also was reminiscing (sic?) on how the last time I recorded something was for an in person interview for the brown daily herald and thinking back to my experiences writing for them. And also thinking back to all the recordings and silly videos my high school friends and I made in our video production classes."
